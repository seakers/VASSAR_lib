solution: have fats instead of global variables that indicate that objectives are fully satisfied

replace  (test (eq (worth-improving-measurement ?p) TRUE))
by (not (REASONING::fully-satisfied (subobjective ?subobj)))
where ?subobj is each subobjective that is related to ?p

********************************8
anotehr solution is to have intermediate rules and facts
for each parameter, create a rule with its related subobj
if (REASONING::fully-satisfied (subobjective WE7-9))
for all of them, then assert (dontimprovemeasurement ?p)
and use this fact in synergies
