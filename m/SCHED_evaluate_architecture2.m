% sequence = [4,3,2,7,...] sequence(j) = i means mission i from lost of mission
% is flown in jth position
% 
% 0) Launch dates are calculated using input sequence, and budgets and
% mission costs from params
% 1) The RBES is used to calculate raw undiscounted mission scores, with
% all synergies considered
% 2) Discounted value = sum of mission values to each panel, weighted by discount
% rate factors
% 3) Data continuity score (directly from RBES): computes sum of values of
% measurements covered by architecture
